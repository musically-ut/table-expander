Unmerge merged columns from tables copied from web-pages.


The HTML page with Tailwind CSS offers a practical solution for users facing issues when copying tables from web pages into Excelâ€”a process that often results in merged columns due to differences in browser handling of table data. While Internet Explorer managed this task effectively, modern Chromium-based browsers like Microsoft Edge do not maintain the column separation. This tool specifically addresses this problem by allowing users to paste the improperly merged table data into a text area and then "unmerge" the columns automatically, restoring the intended structure of the data for use in applications like Excel. For more context on this issue, please refer to the discussion on Microsoft's support forum: [Microsoft Edge Community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftedge/forum/all/pasting-table-from-webpage-to-excel/449f0d05-bb77-4c43-82b4-61225feccecd).
